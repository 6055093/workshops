    `Right now the game ends in 1 second. Make this random (from 500ms to 1300ms)`,
    `Add a third button`,
    `There's a lot of repetition in the code. Let's fix this.
    Write a function that adds a button. The function takes one parameter, which is
    the button index. Why is this parameter needed?`,
    `Make a random number of buttons appear. You'll need to modify the clicked variable declaration`,
    `For this question, start from scratch *without copy pasting*. Create a game.
    In this game, there is one button. The user has to click on that button 3 times in 500ms`,
    `If the last question was very hard, start this one from scratch. Add a feature to this game: the number
    of times remaining is labeled on the button. Also, the number of clicks needed is random from 2 to 5`,
    `If the last question was very hard, start this one from scratch. Make the button appear
    after a random amount of time`,
    `If the last question was very hard, start this one from scratch. Add a restart button`,
    `Every time the button is clicked, it changes to a random position`,
    `There are a random number of buttons and each one you have to click a random number of times`
