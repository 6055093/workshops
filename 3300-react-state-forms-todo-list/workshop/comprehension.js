        `How many components are in this project? How many times does each component appear in the virtual DOM?`,

        and others we had no choice. Seperate the method names into the two categories.`,
        `When does the onSubmit of the form get triggered? What happens when you press enter in the input box?`,
        `What is the best way to console log the state after you call setState? Can you do it immediately after?`,
        `The onSubmit and onChange methods take a parameter which we called event. Is the name of this parameter important?`,
        `Where is the setState method defined?`,
        `Do we call the onChange method ourselves? If not, where does it get called?`,
        `Why do we store the value of the input box in the state?`,
        `Why does the input box have a value prop? What would happen if you removed it?`
